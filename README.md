# Signal-Processing-MATLAB

This is a project coded in MATLAB. Basically we play around with signals, like representing its phoenetics, passing it through and LPF, HPF etc. both in time and frequency domains. The word file will give more of an insight as to what this is about.

I had coded this project back in November 2023, when I was in my 3rd semester at college. Uploaded it on GitHub for future reference.

To get started:
1. Download MATLAB
2. Open the file in MATLAB
3. In the directory where you save the file (with the code), also save the recording you want to be processed.
4. You can record anything, just make sure the file is of type .wav and with the name, Recording.
